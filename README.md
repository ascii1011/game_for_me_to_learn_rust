# game_for_me_to_learn_rust

The goal for this game was to create a game that pushed me to learn RUST.

This game should include, but not limited to:
- game loop
- support game play with the user state being maintained
- end game and provide ranking

current focus on:
 - variable / structs / local store (stateful)
 - game state
 - abstraction (also library)
 - reusablity
 - ownership

 future:
  - db
  - basic graphics
